# Contributing to Content Review Filters

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

This code is a fully separated subset of code that is used in the internal Meta codebases. As such, we are treating this repository as a mirror of the internal codebase that is generalizable to the open source world. Since this repo is an example of how to use the Content Review Filters, we plan to keep the functionality limited to the core implementation logic.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
